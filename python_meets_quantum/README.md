## Python Meets Quantum

06-06, 13:30–15:00 (Europe/London), Doddington Forum

This workshop is designed for Python developers eager to explore the exciting world of quantum computing. Through 
interactive exercises and practical coding examples, participants will learn how to program quantum computers using 
Python. No advanced background in quantum mechanics is required - just curiosity and a willingness to dive into 
cutting-edge technology.

Quantum Computing Fundamentals

A beginner-friendly introduction to key quantum concepts: qubits, superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates.
Understand why quantum computing is groundbreaking and how it differs from classical computing.
Getting Started with Quantum Programming in Python

Hands-on setup: installing and configuring Qiskit and other essential libraries.
Build and execute your first quantum circuits.
Developing Quantum Programs

Create and simulate quantum circuits for fundamental algorithms like the Quantum Fourier Transform and Grover’s search.
Learn how to test quantum programs on simulators before running them on real quantum hardware.
