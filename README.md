# GPU Accelerated Python

06-06, 09:00–12:30 (Europe/London), Grand Hall

Accelerating Python using the GPU is much easier than you might think. We will explore the powerful CUDA-enabled Python 
ecosystem in this tutorial through hands-on examples using some of the most popular accelerated scientific computing 
libraries.

Topics include:
- Introduction to General Purpose GPU Computing
- GPU vs CPU - Which processor is best for which tasks
- Introduction to CUDA
- How to use CUDA with Python
- Using Numba to write kernel functions
- CuPy
- cuDF

No prior experience with GPU's is necessary, but attendees should be familiar with Python.

# Introduction to Bayesian Time Series Analysis with PyMC

06-06, 09:00–10:30 (Europe/London), Doddington Forum

Time series data is ubiquitous, from stock market prices and weather patterns to disease outbreaks and sports outcomes. 
Accurately modeling these data and generating useful predictions requires specialized techniques due to the unique 
characteristics of time series data. This tutorial provides a practical introduction to Bayesian time series analysis 
using PyMC, a powerful probabilistic programming library in Python. Participants will learn how to build, evaluate, and 
interpret various Bayesian time series models, including ARIMA models, dynamic linear models, and stochastic volatility 
models. We'll emphasize practical application, covering data preprocessing, model selection, diagnostics, and 
forecasting, empowering attendees to tackle real-world time series problems with confidence.

Traditional time series methods often struggle with complex patterns, uncertainty quantification, and incorporating 
prior knowledge. Bayesian methods offer a robust alternative, providing a flexible framework for handling these 
challenges. This tutorial will equip participants with the skills to leverage the power of Bayesian time series analysis
using PyMC.

This tutorial is designed for data scientists, analysts, and researchers with some familiarity with Python and basic 
statistical concepts. Prior experience with time series analysis is helpful but not strictly required. A basic 
understanding of probability distributions and Bayesian inference will be beneficial, but we will review key concepts. 
Participants should be comfortable working with Jupyter notebooks.

By the end of this tutorial, participants will be able to:

Understand the advantages of Bayesian time series analysis.
Implement various Bayesian time series models using PyMC.
Preprocess time series data for Bayesian modeling.
Perform model selection and comparison.
Evaluate model fit and diagnose potential issues.
Generate forecasts and interpret results.
Apply Bayesian time series methods to real-world datasets.

# Forecasting Weather using Time Series ML

06-06, 11:00–12:30 (Europe/London), Doddington Forum

This session's header image
This hands-on workshop covers how to use open source ML models like LSTMs and TimeSeries LLM's, with Python to try to 
forecast weather patterns, with best practices for data preparation and real time predictions.

Weather patterns are notoriously challenging to predict, typically requiring sophisticated satellite technology and 
advanced modeling techniques. However, recent advancements in deep learning for time series forecasting offer powerful 
new methods to tackle this complexity.

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn to try to forecast weather conditions for the next six months using Python, 
Google Colab, InfluxDB and popular libraries like Neural Prophet and state of the art Time Series LLMs. Learn the 
strengths, weaknesses, and common pitfalls of each approach, from classical techniques (ARIMA) to using Transformers. 
We’ll explore data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, with practical examples and ready-to-use notebooks. All 
code and instructions will be available on GitHub, ensuring you can continue exploring time series forecasting beyond 
the session.
