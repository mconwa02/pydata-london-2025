## GPU Accelerated Python

06-06, 09:00â€“12:30 (Europe/London), Grand Hall
Accelerating Python using the GPU is much easier than you might think. We will explore the powerful CUDA-enabled Python ecosystem in this tutorial through hands-on examples using some of the most popular accelerated scientific computing libraries.

Topics include:
- Introduction to General Purpose GPU Computing
- GPU vs CPU - Which processor is best for which tasks
- Introduction to CUDA
- How to use CUDA with Python
- Using Numba to write kernel functions
- CuPy
- cuDF

No prior experience with GPU's is necessary, but attendees should be familiar with Python.
